# PDF Comments V7 - All 7 Comments

## Comment 1: Section Titles & Spacing
- Check the title of each section makes sense, or change for something better
- More space between each section, they are too close to each other

## Comment 2: Single Product Card Width
- If user chose only one product, do NOT extend the box over the full page
- It should be only half the page horizontally (like the screenshot shows)

## Comment 3: Investment Section Issues (MULTIPLE)
- License monthly patent is NOT zero - it must show the actual value
- A plan MUST always be selected - "none selected" is not possible
- Custo mensal recorrente at zero is not possible
- Frequency comparison: remove "/mês" from values since "Mensal" is already in the title. Numbers should be aligned across the whole page
- Estimativa pós-pago: Give the breakdown and price per unit exactly how it's calculated and seen in the calculadora page

## Comment 4: First Payment Rule (NEW BUSINESS RULE)
- When client chooses monthly or semestral frequency, vendor can choose if first payment is "à vista" or in 2x
- First payment of the client will ALWAYS be: implantação + first month (or first semester) depending on what was chosen

## Comment 5: Metrics Cards Alignment
- IMOB and LOCAÇÃO cards are not aligned (drew red line to show)
- If client enters a price for boleto and split, make sure it's a bit closer on the left

## Comment 6: Page 2 Revenue Section
- Remove "/mês" below the value (no need since title says it)
- Title should be "Fonte de Receita Mensal" (not "Fontes de Receita")

## Comment 7: Financial Summary Consistency
- If showing total monthly revenues, must also show total monthly costs (investimento)
- In the whole page, instead of "cost" use "investimento" everywhere
