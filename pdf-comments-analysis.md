# PDF Comments Analysis

## Comment 1 (Header area):
- More space between CLIENTE and the banner
- Client font should be bigger
- "Natureza de negócio" - one of the 3 boxes should be colored in transparent red (pink) matching what was selected on the calculator page

## Comment 2 (Métricas do Negócio):
- Numbers are too separated from their labels
- Checkboxes are not aligned - looks like the 80s
- Numbers should be well highlighted/prominent - these are fundamental in the proposal
- Should look modern, not like something from the 80s

## Comment 3 (Solução em análise de contratação):
- THIS IS PERFECT - the pink highlighted box for selected option
- Font, size of box, size of title - this should be the REFERENCE for everything else
- All selected items everywhere should use this same highlighting style

## Comment 4 (Add-ons):
- Remove the blue/azul callout box
- Highlight all add-ons selected by the user using the same pink style as "Solução em análise de contratação"

## Comment 5 (Frequência de pagamento):
- PERFECT - the pink highlighted box for selected frequency is correct

## Additional requirement from user message:
- ALL user selections must be reflected/highlighted in the PDF
- The "Comparação com outras Frequências de Pagamentos" section must calculate properly:
  - Use the SAME metrics/config but change ONLY the frequency
  - Show the monthly equivalent for each frequency so user can compare apples to apples
  - Compare orange with orange (same base, different frequency)
