PDF Generation Debug Notes
==========================

Issue: html2pdf.js (which uses html2canvas internally) does NOT support OKLCH color functions.
Error: "Attempting to parse an unsupported color function 'oklch'"

Root cause: Tailwind CSS 4 uses OKLCH color format for all CSS variables. 
html2canvas cannot parse oklch() colors.

Solution options:
1. Use inline styles with hex/rgb colors instead of CSS variables in the ProposalPrintLayout component
2. Convert all oklch colors to hex/rgb before passing to html2pdf
3. Override CSS variables with hex equivalents in the print container

Best approach: Use ONLY inline styles with hex/rgb colors in the ProposalPrintLayout.
No Tailwind classes that resolve to oklch colors. All colors must be hardcoded hex values.
